We are building APIs that follows TM Forums API specifications. All of the work
we want to do is described in @SPEC.md and we have created the tasks for you in
@TODO.md.

Select one of the tasks from @TODO.md, implement it according to the
specifications in @SPEC.md, and create a well described commit with your
changes.

Feel free to add more tasks to @TODO.md if you find something that needs to be
done.

Output <promise>COMPLETE</promise> when all tasks in @TODO.md are done.
